The DisputeResolution contract allows users to submit disputes and resolve them through the contract.
Each dispute is assigned a unique ID, and the contract maintains the submitter's and respondent's addresses, description of the dispute, and the status.

The submitDispute function allows users to submit a new dispute by providing the respondent's address and a description of the dispute as parameters.
It increments the disputeCount and adds the new dispute to the disputes mapping.

The resolveDispute function allows the parties involved in a dispute (submitter and respondent) to resolve the dispute by providing the dispute ID and the desired status (DisputeStatus) as parameters.
It checks that the dispute is in the "Pending" status and updates the status accordingly.

The onlyParties modifier is used to restrict certain functions (like resolveDispute) to be accessible only by the submitter or the respondent of the dispute.
